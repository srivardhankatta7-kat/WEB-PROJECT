# 🌱 AgroGuide DSS (v2.4 Pro)
### Crop Recommendation & Agronomic Decision Support System

An advanced agricultural decision-support software application engineered for smallholder farmers, agronomists, and researchers. The system combines continuous biological trapezoidal response functions with empirical machine learning benchmarks to deliver transparent, explainable, and multi-factor crop recommendations.

## 🌟 Key Features Implemented

### 1. 📖 Documented Recommendation Method & Inherent Limitations
- **Multi-Factor Agronomic Scoring Engine:**
  - Evaluates **9 environmental and edaphic parameters**: Rainfall (18%), Ambient Temperature (18%), Soil pH (14%), Soil Texture Compatibility (14%), NPK Macronutrients (14%), Atmospheric Humidity (12%), and Sowing Season (10%).
  - Employs **continuous trapezoidal biological membership functions** with non-linear penalty multipliers ($0.50 - 0.65\times$) for critical limiting factors (e.g. extreme pH, water deficit, thermal stress, off-season sowing).
  - **Graceful Missing Data Handling:** Automatically activates proportional weight redistribution when lab NPK data is omitted, while adjusting the Data Completeness Index and safety confidence flags.
- **Explicit System Limitations Documented:**
  - *Microclimatic & Topographical Variations:* Inability of macro-weather data to capture slope aspect, valley frost pockets, and windbreaks.
  - *Biological Vectors:* Unpredictable pest migrations (e.g., locust swarms), soil cyst nematodes, and viral pathogens.
  - *Sub-surface Stratigraphy:* Subsoil hardpans and calcic horizons below 20 cm topsoil.
  - *Socio-Economic & Mandi Dynamics:* Market price volatility, cold storage deficits, and distance to APMC procurement centers.
  - *Farmer Self-Reporting Bias:* Paper test strip inaccuracies vs. NABL-accredited spectrophotometry.
  - *Statutory Advisory Mandate:* Clear guidance recommending consultation with local Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) and ICAR extension officers.

### 2. ⚖️ Comparison Results & Automated Short Test Report
- **Multi-Crop Side-by-Side Trade-off Analysis:**
  - Interactive comparison tool comparing up to 4 crops across overall suitability, water footprint, duration, yields, market value, and factor-by-factor radars.
- **Rule Engine vs. k-NN Algorithmic Comparison:**
  - Side-by-side execution comparing continuous agronomic rules against normalized multi-dimensional Euclidean k-NN distance vectors.
- **Automated Verification Test Suite (8 Test Suites):**
  - TC-01: Indo-Gangetic Wetland Kharif Scenario (Rice/Sugarcane verified top, Bajra penalized).
  - TC-02: Semi-Arid Deccan Plateau Low Rainfall Scenario (Pearl Millet/Sorghum top, Rice penalized).
  - TC-03: Northwest Irrigated Cool Rabi Scenario (Wheat/Mustard/Gram top, tropical crops penalized).
  - TC-04: Subtropical Hill Slopes Acidic Soil Scenario (Tea/Coffee top, field cereals penalized).
  - TC-05: Missing NPK Graceful Degradation & Completeness Index Test.
  - TC-06: Severe Acid Soil Boundary Stress Test (pH 4.0; verifies Lime amendment trigger).
  - TC-07: Extreme Heatwave Stress Boundary Test (42°C; verifies thermal penalty).
  - TC-08: Severe Drought Boundary Test (160 mm; verifies drought warnings).
- **Short Test Report:** Real-time test execution status (8/8 passed, 100% success rate, latency < 5ms) with print/export capabilities and SHA256 integrity checksum.

### 5. 🗓️ Season-Aware Suggestions & Sowing Calendar
- **Dynamic Season Detection:** Real-time calculation of the current active Indian agricultural season based on calendar month:
  - **Kharif** (June – October: Monsoon onset, vegetative growth, harvest window)
  - **Rabi** (October – March: Cool post-monsoon winter sowing, grain ripening)
  - **Zaid** (March – June: Fast-maturing summer cash crops & cucurbits)
- **Season Smart Filter:** One-click toggle to highlight in-season crops and flag off-season crops requiring polyhouse/protected cultivation.
- **National Agricultural Cropping Calendar:** Expandable reference guide for sowing and harvest cycles across major Indian field crops.
